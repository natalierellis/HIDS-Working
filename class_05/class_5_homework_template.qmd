# Multi-stakeholder COVID Registry

3 DC Hospitals, MGUH, Sibley and GW want to collaborate and share data on all their COVID patients to learn about how to improve clinical care.
Each hospital uses a different EMR, with different data models and tools.
For your proposal, assume that your team will coordinate the process and host the data. 

## Cohort

What patients will be included, with specific logic to select them.


```{sql connection=con}
```

What data in addition to patient IDs will you include, and why?
Obviously you will want when they were diagnosed and age/gender, but what other data points? Where are they located? Specify table and how you will extract them.

```{sql connection=con}
```

## Data Integration

How will you assure that data from all 3 hospitals can be analyzed as a single data set?
Be specific, use examples from "our" data.

```{sql connection=con}
```


## Outcomes

What outcomes will you track, and why? Specify which data (table etc) will be needed to support tracking these outcomes.

```{sql connection=con}
```
